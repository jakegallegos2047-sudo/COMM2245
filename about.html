      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is <b>Jacob Gallegos</b>.  
      I am a Senior at <b>UNM</b> with a focus in <i>Cybersecurity</i>.  
      I don’t actually take a lot of pictures of myself, so I thought I’d include something that represents me instead — the car below, which I hope to own one day! (This exact car might be a stretch but I would love to!)</p>

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lacrosse: Drexel in the CAA & Archers in the PLL </li>
        <li>Hockey: Ice Wolves in the NAHL and The Coyotes in the NHL. May they rest in peace.</li>
        <li>Working with my hands — woodworking, cars, 3D printing, just about anything I can get my hands on!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I also really enjoy <i>programming, cybersecurity, and technology as a whole!</i></p>
